Compression & Decompression of timestamps to ~10bits/timestamp
==========

## Problem Setup:
There is a stream of timestamps that need to be transferred across some network stream; Goal is to compress this sequence of timestamps (with microseconds accuracy, lossless). Also the encoding and decoding process should be very fast so that it can scale for time critical processess;

#### Some assumptions:
 - The data to be transmitted consists of a sequence of real time unix timestamps with microsecond accuracy
 - Timestamps are always increasing;
 - In this dataset timestamps belong to 24 hour range (however this shouldn't affect the algorithm);
 - Consider it a stream of timestamps, so classical compression algorithms might not work; The alogrithm should be able to start and stop at any index of timestamp;

 
## Expected Flow: 
```
timestamps ->足足 ENCODER -> encoded_timestamps ->足足 DECODER -> decoded_timestamps

IF timestamps == decoded_timestamps: SUCCESS
ELSE: FAIL
```

## Solution:
So a single timestamp looks like `1364281200.078739` - with micro seconds accuracy. The input file, it is stored in, is in raw format and it's treated as charecters so every timestamp along with newline charecter will take:

`18 charecters` = `18 bytes` = `144 bits`

Total no of timestamps in file = `451210` = `7.74MB` = `8121779 bytes`

#### Attempt 01:
The data need not be stored as raw text, if we simply remove the dot and newline charecter itself, it reduces the data to `16bytes/timestamp` i.e. `128bits/timestamp`.

Now each timestamp in here can be stored in 7bytes (either store it as a single value, removing `dot` or consider both of them separate - A.B, such that A part need `4 Bytes` `(32 bits)` & B part needs `3Bytes` (max value possible is 999999 - it can be stored in `20 bits`, but reserving space for now, will optimize later)). So with this we can reduce the data to `7Bytes = 56bits/timestamp` if stored in binary format.

However, in the first approach itself I'd like to take advantage of the fact that these are increasing timestamps. So rather than storing the whole value we can store the delta. So I will store the first value as is: `7Bytes`.
From the 2nd timestamp I'll store them as delta with previous value:

Here's some analysis before I do the math:
For the given dataset I did an analysis on delta of the integer part and here's the distribution:

```
DeltaValue	Frequency
0	        423898
1	        17439
2	        4215
3	        1892
4	        1092
5               2348
6               105
7               68
8               50
9               29
10              22
11              19
12              5 
13              7 
14              3 
15              4 
16              3
17              1
18              2
19              1
20              2
22              1
24              1
28              1
32              2
```

_Figure 1: Distribution of delta values_

So majorly `(> 50%)` is 0 delta or 1 delta. Since the smallest size of data that can be written to a file is 1 Byte, we'd encode data in byte by byte format; We'd want to store delta values with high distribution in smaller size chunks to reduce size; So I'll encode them with bit prefixes something like this:

```
00 000000 - indicates zero delta.
01 000000 - indicates '1' delta
10 xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx - indicates delta between [2,32], will have to read next 22 bits to encode information about the delta value.
11 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx - indicates possible delta value 4bytes will be read.
```

For now Will plainly encode the decimal value (999999 maxvalue) in 20bits after the int value. We will need one more bit to store negative value; so total 21 bits for decimal value;

this way size requirements shall be:
```
4Byte + 3Byte + (21bits * 452109) + (2*423898 + 2*17439 + 8*9873)
>> 10456003bits

>> 23.127 bits/timestamp
```

I'll implement this as first version and try to achieve this theoretical number.

**`SUMMARY of implementation`** <BR>
As mentioned before, without buffering values in memory, we can only write byte by byte to file. Hence, for first two cases (00 & 01) 1 byte is used and for case 3 (10) - 4 bytes is used and for case 4 (not found in testfile) - 7 bytes is supposed to be used;

After running the code, it reduced the file to `1345KB` = `1377280Bytes` which is equal to `24.419Bits / timestamp`. So this satisfies the minimum criteria but is pretty far away from `10bits/timestamp`.

Ok, compression ratio is not awesome, but `C++`, `IO` & `Bits manipulation` skills are now brushed up. Will try a better approach now;

##### SO FAR: 23.127 bits/timestamp

#### Attempt 02:
Looking at the integer value and decimal value is adding overheads. I'd rather look at the number on the whole; Quickly calculated the delta values between consecutive numbers using simple python script `helper.py`.
Using Excel here's the histogram based on no of bits needed to store the delta values:

_Figure 2: histogram of decimal values_

So >50% of delta is between [0,1]. And a good portion of them lie between [2, 14] bits needed; So if we encode it as following:

| Summaries    | Count  | BITS NEEDED | Storage pattern |
|--------------|--------|-------------| --------------- |
| [0,1]        | 235916 | 2           | 00 000000 = 0 & 01 000000 = 1 |
| [2, 14]      | 125021 | 16          | 10 xxxxxx xxxxxxxx |
| REST         | 90272  | 32          | 11 xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx |

Check `deltaValues.xlsx` for more details.

This way total no of bits needed will be:
`64 + 8 * 235916 + 16 * 125021 + 32 * 90272 = 6776432` i.e. `15.0183 Bits/timestamp`

Now we are wasting around 75% space when storing 0 or 1, as only two bits are needed to encode them; Will try to encode more information in these regions in coming attempts

The result after experimentation are:
Sample dataset reduced to: `807168Bytes` = `14.311Bits/Timestamp`

As a minor optimisation, I have changed code to store [15, 22] bit delta values in 3bytes; After this size of encoded file is: `739750Bytes` = `13.1158Bits / Timestamp`

##### SO FAR: 13.115 bits/timestamp

#### Attempt 03
**Note:** Untill now the algorithm was purely looking at information that came so far; To compress further I'm going to look ahead now, there were a lot of cases where large delta's were followed by single `0` or `1`. So shall reserve the two bits at the end of bigger models => (2, 3 & 4 byte models) with following information:

```
01 - if followed by a 0
10 - if followed by a 1
```

So everytime we observe a large delta, rather than writing to file immediately we'll buffer the data and write if next timestamp match the condition (delta being 0 or 1). By just encoding next one or zero in previous set of information, was able to reduce the encoded data to: `600125Bytes` = `10.64Bits/timestamp`.

After this added one more level of buffering to encode sequence of two zeros (two consequtive zeros) as 11; That brought encoded file size down to: `584352Bytes` = `10.36Bits/timestamp`

##### SO FAR: 10.36 bits/timestamp

#### Attempt 04
In case of one byte model where we encode 0 or 1 (without any buffering) as `00000000` and `00100000` respectively; last 5 bits do not contain any information and are free and it can be used to store 32 unique sequences of 0 & 1; 

Now if the sequence of delta is like 0 0 0 1 0 1 0, we can use the remaining bits in 1Byte model to encode them; Tried doing this:
After a 0 or 1 if next delta is 0 or 1 I'd encode 10 or 01 in free bit space in 1byte model; With this I got an encoded file of:
### 569463 Bytes =  10.097 Bits/timestamp

If we build a mapping of sequences based on popularity and encode them in these bits when observed we'd be able to reduce the data further;

 - To be done!!

## SO FINALLY: 10.097 bits/timestamp

#### Not a part of my solution but :O
If we zip the encoded file it's further reduced to `527355Bytes` = `9.35Bits/timestamp`;

## How to build & test
The code is written as a VC++ project; You might need Visual Studio (Windows) to compile & test; It has some dependency on Windows (I have used windows.h header for some profiling tasks, can be removed). Here's link on [How to compile windows visual C++ code on linux] if need be;(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37575454/how-to-compile-windows-visual-c-code-on-linux)

In windows, open `VSProject\TC.sln`, build the solution and run; the dataset file is included in the solution (& copied to output path during build; the output file is generated in `VSProject\TC\`). Executable is generated at `VSProject\Debug\TC.exe` during the build;

You can run against the binary I built in my system, it's there in root folder of the zip: TC.exe

```bash
# encoding
TC.exe -e timestamps.txt timestamps_encoded.txt
# decoding
TC.exe -d timestamps_encoded.txt timestamps_decoded.txt
# validation (using FC utility, alternative to diff in linux)
FC timestamps.txt timestamps_decoded.txt
```

There is `test.cmd` to try this out;

Here's sample output I got:
```bash
>TC.exe -e timestamps.txt timestamps_encoded.txt
Begin Encoding
Encoding done; Processed: 451210 rows
Time taken (in micro seconds) : 9798.17
Avg Time taken (in micro seconds) : 0.0217153

>TC.exe -d timestamps_encoded.txt timestamps_decoded.txt
Begin Decoding
Decoding done; Processed: 451210 rows
Time taken (in micro seconds) : 8218.85
Avg Time taken (in micro seconds) : 0.0182151

>FC timestamps.txt timestamps_decoded.txt
Comparing files timestamps.txt and TIMESTAMPS_DECODED.TXT
FC: no differences encountered
```

## How to validate
In windows:
```bash
cd VSProject\TC\
FC timestamps.txt timestamps_decoded.txt
```

Output I got:
```
Comparing files timestamps.txt and TIMESTAMPS_DECODED.TXT
FC: no differences encountered
```

## Metrics (also available in `.\metrics.txt`)

### Degree of compression
In the final attemp was able to reduce the data to:
`569463Bytes =  10.097 Bits/timestamp`

### Time taken: (Encoding)
Encoding: `9798.17ms (total) => 0.0217153ms / timestamp`

### Time taken: (Decoding)
Decoding: `8218.85ms (total) => 0.0182151 / timestamp`

## Ideas to further improve the model
 - 1byte model has 5 (can even use 6) empty bits, can use that to represent 63 different sequences;
